# AirBnB_clone

**Project Description:**
This project is an Airbnb clone, aiming to replicate some of the core functionalities of the popular accommodation booking platform. It includes features such as managing users, properties (e.g., listings), bookings, and more.

**Command Interpreter:**
The command interpreter is a tool built into the Airbnb clone project, allowing users to interact with the system through a command-line interface (CLI). It provides a convenient way to perform various operations such as creating users, managing properties, retrieving data, and more.

**How to Start the Command Interpreter:**
To start the command interpreter, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the `airbnb_console.py` script using Python:

```bash
python(3) airbnb_console.py
```

**How to Use the Command Interpreter:**
Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands and arguments to perform various actions within the Airbnb clone project. The interpreter will display prompts and responses to guide you through the process.

**Examples:**
Here are some examples of commands you can use with the command interpreter:

1. Create a new user:
   ```bash
   create User JohnDoe john@example.com
   ```

2. Retrieve information about a property:
   ```bash
   show Place 123
   ```

3. Update the details of a user:
   ```bash
   update User 456 email newemail@example.com
   ```

4. Delete a booking:
   ```bash
   destroy Booking 789
   ```
